	<figcaption>I loved Firenze so much so I changed my plan to spend about half a day more and then move to Roma. First, I visited the Uffizi Gallery. Since you should wait in a long waiting line without a reservation, I highly recommend visiting after making a reservation.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>The museum is very spacious and the exhibition style is unique. In particular, the use of statues to naturally draw attention to specific artwork is impressive.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>Numerous works of art placed in a room of the Academia Gallery (left). Maybe it was an assignment submitted by students at the time. The video explanation of the process of replicating a statue was also interesting (right).</figcaption>
