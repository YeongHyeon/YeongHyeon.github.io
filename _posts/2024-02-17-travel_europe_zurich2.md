	<figcaption>Lake walk. Perhaps because of the time difference, I woke up early. It started raining suddenly, so we decided to go to a nearby museum, Museum Rietberg.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>I took the tram to go to the museum. The interior of the tram was like a room. Because I missed the place to get off, so just decided to stop by Starbucks for a warm drink.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>I tried using the exit in the opposite direction of the trail. Maybe this was the main gate.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>Since the rain didn't stop, I decided to go to the Swiss National Museum. On the way, there was a Freitag flagship store, so I took a short look around.</figcaption>

	</p>
	<figcaption>The building was made up of stacked containers, and the inner space was connected by steel stairs. There was a laptop bag caught my eye, but I didn't want to increase my luggage. So I just bought a small pouch with the same pattern.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Swiss National Museum (Landesmuseum)

	<figcaption>At the Swiss National Museum (Landesmuseum). I think this is the first time in my life that I have visited two museums in one day. Actually, I visited one more museum after this place in a same day.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>One of the most impressive exhibitions in the museum. The country of Switzerland was constructed as a 3D structure, and information about each region was obtained through AR technology. The AR equipment was installed as a fixed telescope-shaped device, and an iPhone with dedicated software installed was also provided.</figcaption>
